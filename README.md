# Shspace
 Simple game like Asteroids written in C++ using SDL.
 In this project, I learned:
 - How to work with SDL
 - Learned how to write a game loop
 - Learned how to organize game using game objects
 - Implemented scene system
 - Learned some parts of STL
 - Learned how to organize base game engine


Despite that, the code is pretty messy, so be warned.
